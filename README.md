Central Limit Theorem
========================================================

This is a simple Shiny web application demonstrating the Central Limit Theorem.
Written by Jochen Laubrock, based on a github [contribution](https://github.com/tgouhier/climit) by Tarik Gouhier.  

To run the application, you need a web browser, [R](http://www.r-project.org), and the *shiny* package. You might need to install the latter:  
`install.packages("shiny")`  

You then start the application by navigation to the directory and calling  
`library(shiny)`  
`runApp()`

The deployed version of this app can be found at http://xjlc.shinyapps.io/climit.
